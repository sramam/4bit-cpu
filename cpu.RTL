Registers:
    A (4-bit accumulator)
    B (4-bit general-purpose register)
    PC (program counter)
    IR (instruction register)
    FLAGS (carry flag, zero flag)

Instruction Set:
    1. LOAD A, imm (Load immediate value into register A)
    2. LOAD B, imm (Load immediate value into register B)
    3. ADD A, B (Add registers A and B, store the result in A)
    4. SUB A, B (Subtract B from A, store the result in A)
    5. STORE A, B (Store the value of A into B)
    6. JMP imm (Jump to address imm)
    7. JZ imm (Jump to address imm if zero flag is set)
    8. JC imm (Jump to address imm if carry flag is set)
    9. HLT (Halt the CPU)

Control Unit State Machine:
    1. Fetch: Read instruction from memory at address PC, store it in IR, increment PC
    2. Decode: Interpret the opcode in IR and set control signals accordingly
    3. Execute: Perform the operation specified by the control signals and update registers
    4. Repeat steps 1-3 until a HLT instruction is encountered
